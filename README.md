The task was to answer question of a brief that revloved around the famous n-body problem where we had to explore calculating different things to see how accurate we are.

This task was very much a simplified version but the computing still remained somewhat complex and I spent a long time trying to solve this.

I believe I got full marks for this assignment in my final year.
